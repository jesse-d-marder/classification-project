### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to identify drivers of customer churn at Telco. I will try to answer the question of why customers churn and provide recommendations for reducing customer churn.

### Initial Questions and Hypotheses

    - Do any groups of customers churn at higher than the overall average rate?
    - Do any groups of customers churn at lower than the overall average rate?
    - For the month to month plan - do churners pay more than non churners? 
    - Of the groups that churn at higher than overall average, do any particular sub groups churn higher?
    - Within the sub groups do any specific options lead to higher churn?
